Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment? Gemma
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend? Tuesday 7-9
- What are your initial impressions of Java? The "vocabs" for the language is infamiliar to me, and a little harder to get than python. But the structure of processing OOP progams is very understandable.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? I do think Python is very good for procedural programming, and OOP can be done as well. I can see that Java is designed to be object oriented.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


The first thing I did was to review Java the language, as I did not fully catch up in class. (just a small suggestion: is it possible for us to go through coding examples in class just a little bit slower and clearer? Because I am so infamilliar with the language although I understand what the programming goal is, it takes me so much time to process and match specific coding pieces after class)

I tried to plan out what function of the chatbox goes where and fill the plan in with specific codes. I do understand what I want the computer to perform but due to unfamiliarity with Java the language I can only ask TA for help very often because I just do not see what syntax I should use where.

I hope there can be more tutorial on Java's syntax. Or just a friendly hint about the syntax we should be aware of can be very helpful. I will also preview the textbook often to self-study Java.

I encountered problems with running Java because my VS code had some trouble showing the run button. I spent days to figure it out. Finally I can run it and change my code based on the feedback.
